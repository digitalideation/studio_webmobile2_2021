Diagrams are an important part of a technical documentation. They help someone new to the project (or your future self) to get a quick understanding of your system. They can also help you when you plan your system before you start implementing. Diagrams can be drawn a different levels of abstraction and focus on different parts of your system. In this course, you are required to hand-in a sequence diagram describing the communication and a system architecture diagram that shows the most important components in your system and how they related to each other.

* [UML modelling language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language). A modelling language that offers multiple standard ways to model a system, for example with sequence diagrams.
* [Sequence diagram (in German)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequenzdiagramm)
* There is no standard way for system architecture diagrams. It should contain at least the most important parts of your system (client, server, databases, etc.) and how they communicated with each other. Optionally, it can also contain information on the technologies used in the components.
