Diagrams are an important part of a technical documentation. They help someone new to the project (or your future self) to get a quick understanding of your system. They can also help you when you plan your system before you start implementing. Diagrams can be drawn a different levels of abstraction and focus on different parts of your system. In this course, you are required to hand-in a sequence diagram describing the communication and a system architecture diagram that shows the most important components in your system and how they related to each other.
