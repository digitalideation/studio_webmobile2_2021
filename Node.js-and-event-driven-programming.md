Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment. It runs JavaScript outside of the browser. In this class, we use it to program our backend-server. As such, it is an alternative to platforms using PHP, Java or C# that you might already know. Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used in the Chrome browser. Node.js uses an event-driven architecture with asynchronous I/O which is well suited for real-time applications, for example ones that use WebSockets.
